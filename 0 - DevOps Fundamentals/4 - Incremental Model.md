# Incremental Model

In incremental model software is developed in small parts instead of delivering complete product at once.

The Incremental Model is a method of software development where the product is designed, implemented, and tested incrementally â€” meaning that it is built in small parts or increments. Rather than delivering the complete system at once, development and delivery are split into builds, each of which adds functionality to the existing software. The core idea is to build the software piece by piece, with each part going through a complete SDLC cycle: requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment.

In this requirement divided into multiple modules. Then eash module goes throught the desing, implementation and testing.
