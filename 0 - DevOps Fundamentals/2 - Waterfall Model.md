# WaterFall Model

Waterfall Model is a linear software development approach in which a phase must be completed before moving to next phase.

This model is named waterfall because each phase flows one after other.

```Waterfall Model एक linear और non-iterative process है जिसमे software step-by-step बनता है. हर phase एक के बाद एक follow होता है और पीछे जाने का option नहीं होता. ये model तभी सही काम करता है जब सब कुछ पहले से clear हो और कोई change expect नहीं हो. लेकिन अगर किसी phase मैं कुछ गलती हो गयी तो उससे बाद मैं ठीक करना मुश्किल होता था.```

**1 - Requirement Gathering**:
- Get the requirements from client.

**2 - Design**:
- Architecture is created on the basis of requirement.

**3 - Implementation**:
- Developers write the code in this phase.

**4 - Testing**:
- Testing team test the software and find the bugs.

**5 - Deployment**:
- Software is installed on the client's environment.

**6 - Maintenance**:
- If any problem occured in the software on client's environment, it is fixed in this phase.
