# WaterFall Model

Waterfall Model is a linear software development approach in which a phase must be completed before moving to next phase.

This model is named waterfall because each phase flows one after other.

```Waterfall Model एक linear और non-iterative process है जिसमे software step-by-step बनता है. हर phase एक के बाद एक follow होता है और पीछे जाने का option नहीं होता. ये model तभी सही काम करता है जब सब कुछ पहले से clear हो और कोई change expect नहीं हो. लेकिन अगर किसी phase मैं कुछ गलती हो गयी तो उससे बाद मैं ठीक करना मुश्किल होता था.```

### Phases of Waterfall Model:

It has 6 phases.

**1 - Requirement Gathering**:
- Get the requirements from client.

**2 - Design**:
- Architecture is created on the basis of requirement.

**3 - Implementation**:
- Developers write the code in this phase.

**4 - Testing**:
- Testing team test the software and find the bugs.

**5 - Deployment**:
- Software is installed on the client's environment.

**6 - Maintenance**:
- If any problem occured in the software on client's environment, it is fixed in this phase.

### When to use Waterfall Model?

- **When requirements are clear and stable**
  - When you know exactly what needs to be built from the start and those needs won’t change.

- **When the end goal will not changes**
  - When the end goal of project will not changed.

### Advantages

- **Easy to follow**
  - The steps are clear, so you always know what to do next.
 
- **Tracks progress well**
  - You finish one part before starting the next, so it’s simple to see at what step you are working.
 
- **Lots of paperwork**
  - Every step makes documents (like plans or test results), which are helpful later.
 
- **Perfect for unchanging projects**
  - If you know exactly what you need and it won’t change, this works great.

### Disadvantages

- **Hard to fix mistakes**
  - In the waterfall model, every phase—like planning, designing, or building—must be completed before moving to the next. If you spot a problem late in the process, say during testing, fixing it isn’t simple. You can’t just tweak something small; you often have to backtrack through earlier steps, which can mean redoing a lot of work. You can not fix a problem in between the steps, You have to start work on problem from beginning.
 
- **Needs All Details at the Start**
  - This model expects you to plan every detail at the start and stick to it. But in real life, things change—new ideas pop up, or you realize something won’t work. The waterfall model doesn’t let you adjust easily.
 
- **Bad for Creative Projects**
  - The waterfall model is stiff—it doesn’t let you change direction or try new ideas. If you’re making something new, like a unique app, you might need to tweak things as you go. This model doesn’t allow that.
 
- **Late customer Feedback**
  - When the software is installed in client's environment, then client can able to give the software feedback.
