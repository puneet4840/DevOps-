**1 - Requirement Collection**:

The requirement collection or requirement analysis is the first phase where product analyst or business analyst and sits with the client and gather the funtional requirements, non-functional requirements and business requirements, etc.

e.g., We have a client who wants a Mobile Application for their students:-

Business analyst will gone through a meeting with client and ask the below requirements:

- What the software do (Functional Requirements):
  - A student should be able to log in.
  - A teacher can upload marks.
  - A parent can view their child’s attendance.

- How the software should behave (Non-Functional Requirements):
  - The app should load within 3 seconds.
  - The system should work 24/7 without crashing.
 
- Why the software is being built (Business Requirements):
  - The school wants to reduce paperwork.
  - The company wants to track employee work hours digitally.

Once the requirements gathered, then a team desides whether to take up the project of not.

**2 - Feasibility Study**

In this phase a team of Product Managers, Finance Team, Architects, HR Team, Business Analysts decides whether to take this project or not. It means ```क्या ये प्रोजेक्ट इनको लेना चाहिए या नहीं```. They talk on three things:
- Whether taking up this project will be beneficial for them.
- Do they have enough resources to work on this project.
- Do they have technology to work on this project.

After discussing on the above points they come to a desicion. Whether to take this project or not. If they have decided to take this project they work on design.
