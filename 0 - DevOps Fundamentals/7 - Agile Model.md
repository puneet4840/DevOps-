# Agile Model

Agile is a SDLC model which develop a software in small parts called Iteration or Sprints, instead building everything at once.

The Agile Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. Instead of delivering a complete product at once, Agile delivers small functional parts (called increments) in short cycles called iterations or sprints (typically 1–4 weeks).

Agile ek software development methodology hai jisme product ko small samll parts **(sprints or iterations)** main divide kiya jata hai aur develop kiya jata hai. Har sprint ek functionality hoti hai jo product ka ek part hota hai, uska demo client ko diya jata hai aur feedback liya jata hai, fir next sprint client ke feedback ke basis par plan kiya jata hai.
