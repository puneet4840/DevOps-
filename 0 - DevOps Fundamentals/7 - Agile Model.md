# Agile Model

Agile is a SDLC model which develop a software in small parts called Iteration or Sprints, instead building everything at once.

The Agile Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. Instead of delivering a complete product at once, Agile delivers small functional parts (called increments) in short cycles called iterations or sprints (typically 1–4 weeks).

Agile ek software development methodology hai jisme product ko small samll parts **(sprints or iterations)** main divide kiya jata hai aur develop kiya jata hai. Har sprint ek functionality hoti hai jo product ka ek part hota hai, uska demo client ko diya jata hai aur feedback liya jata hai, fir next sprint client ke feedback ke basis par plan kiya jata hai.

### Agile Model Kab Aaya?

Agile officially 2001 mein aaya jab 17 software developers ne milke ek document publish kiya jise "Agile Manifesto" kehte hain.

### Agile Manifesto

Ye 17 log (jise "Agile Alliance" kaha gaya) snowboarding trip par **Utah, USA** gaye the aur wahan brainstorming karke ek chhoti si file likhi – jise Agile Manifesto kaha gaya. Isme 4 core values aur 12 principles diye gaye.

**4 Agile Values**:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:
  - The people on the team and their communication are more important than strictly following predefined processes (like step-by-step workflows) or relying on tools (like project management software). Effective teamwork drives success.
    
- Working software over comprehensive documentation:
  - Delivering functional software (code that runs and meets user needs) is more valuable than producing detailed documentation (like extensive requirement specs or design diagrams). Documentation is useful but secondary.
    
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:
  - Work closely with the customer (or their representative, like a product owner) throughout development to understand their needs, instead of locking everything into a rigid contract upfront. Regular feedback shapes the product.
    
- Responding to change over following a plan:
  - Be ready to adapt to new requirements, issues, or priorities, even if it means changing the original project plan. Flexibility is key to delivering relevant software.

**12 Agile Principles**:
There are 6 agile principle mentioned below.

- Customer satisfaction through early & continuous delivery:
  - Make the customer happy by delivering working software often, starting early in the project. Each delivery should provide useful functionality.
    
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development:
  - Accept new or updated requirements at any stage, even near the project’s end. Agile is designed to handle changes smoothly.

- Deliver Working Software Frequently:
  - Release usable software often, ideally every 1–4 weeks, to show progress and get feedback. Shorter cycles are preferred.
 
- Business People and Developers Work Together Daily:
  - Developers (who write code) and business stakeholders (like customers or product owners) must communicate daily to align on goals.
 
- Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals:
  - Assemble a team of motivated, skilled people, give them the tools and support they need, and trust them to do the job.
 
- Face-to-Face Communication Is the Most Effective Way to Share Information:
  - Talking **In-person or video calls are the best ways for teams to share ideas and solve problems, rather than relying on emails or documents.
 
- Working Software Is the Primary Measure of Progress:
  - The main way to judge progress is by delivering functional software, not by completing documents or tasks.

<br>

### Agile Ki Zarurat Kyun Padi?

1990s mein software projects fail hone lage the:
- Projects time par complete nahi hote the.
- Clients ka expectation change hota tha lekin system rigid hota tha.
- Testing last mein hoti thi – bugs late milte the.

Isliye developers ne socha ki ek flexible, feedback-based aur fast approach honi chahiye — jisme changes ko welcome kiya ja sake aur client ko jaldi results mil sake.

Agile is problem ka solution le kar aaya. Isme development aur feedback parallel chalte hain. Jab tum ek sprint complete karte ho (maan lo 2 hafton ka), to tumhare paas ek working software ka part hota hai. Client usse dekhta hai, use karta hai, aur turant batata hai ki kya thik hai aur kya badalna chahiye. Agla sprint fir usi feedback ko dhyan mein rakh kar hota hai.

<br>

### Agile Kaam Kaise Karta Hai? (Full Cycle)

- **Product Backlog**:
  - Client (ya Product Owner) batata hai ki usse software mein kya chahiye.
    - Example: “As a user, I want to reset my password.”
  - Ye stories ek To-Do list banai jati hai jise Product Backlog bolte hain.
 
- **Sprint Planning (Plan Banana)**:
  - Sprint ka matlab hota hai: 1–4 week ka time frame jisme kuch specific kaam complete hoga.
  - Team product backlog se kuch stories select karti hai ek sprint ke liye (1–4 week ka time box).
  - Jo user stories product backlog se sprint planning main select hoti hain unko sprint backlog kehte hain.
 
- **Design + Development**:
  - Har sprint mein selected stories ke liye coding + testing hoti hai.
  - Roz ka Daily Stand-up hota hai (15 min meeting jisme sab update dete hain).
 
- **Testing**:
  - Agile mein testing har sprint ke sath hoti hai.
  - Jaise hi feature ban jata hai, QA usse test karta hai.
  - Automation + Manual testing dono ho sakti hai.
  - Har sprint ke end mein ek working code ready hota hai.

- **Delivery (Sprint Review)**:
  - Sprint khatam hone ke baad team client ko demo dikhati hai.
  - Client feedback deta hai.
  - Agar koi change chahiye, to wo next sprint mein add hota hai.
  - Fir next sprint start hota hai.

### Agile Framework

There are multiple agile framework:
- Scrum.
- Kanban.
- Extreme Programming.

**What is a Framework?**

Agile ek soch (mindset/philosophy) hai — jisme kaha gaya ki:
- Chhoti chhoti delivery karo.
- Feedback lo.
- Change accept karo.
- Customer ke saath milke kaam karo.

Lekin ab sawaal ye uthta hai ki ye sab practically kaise kiya jaye? Matlab kaun kis role mein hoga? Kaise kaam divide hoga? Kaise plan banega? Kaise track hoga? Yahi handle karte hain Agile ke frameworks.

It means agile ko practically implement karne ke liye agile framework create kiye gaye.

Frameworks Agile philosophy ko real-life process mein badalte hain — jisme roles, rules, tools, time, meetings, sab kuch clearly defined hota hai.

**Tools used for Scrum and Kanban**

Jira, Trello are both used for Scrum and Kanban.


**Why do we need Framework in Agile?**

Jab Agile manifesto bana, to usne sirf values aur principles diye the. Lekin har company alag hai — koi chhoti team hai, koi 100 logon ka project chala rahi hai. Har kisi ko ek structure chahiye tha jisme wo Agile ko apne setup mein use kar sakein.

Frameworks isi structure ko define karte hain. Har framework ek specific type ke project ya team ke liye bana hota hai.


<br>

### Scrum

Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps team to manage their work through set of values, principle and practices.

Scrum is the agile framework that is used to develop, deliver the softwares.

Scrum ek agile ka framework hai iska matlab agile ke steps ko implement karne ke liye kuch steps likh diye gaye. Scrum main kaam ko chhoti-chhoti time-boxed cycles mein divide kiya jata hai, jise Sprints kehte hain. Har Sprint ke end par ek working software deliver kiya jata hai.

<br>

**When to use Scrum?**

Scrum jab use hota hai jab tumhari team chote size ki ho (5 - 10 log), client ki requirment frequently change ho rahi ho, jab choti choti features ko jaldi deliver karna ho. Aur feedback pe based development chahiye hota hai.

**Scrum Roles (Who works in Scrum)**

Scrum has three roles:

- **Product Owner**:
  - Client ka representative hota hai.
  - Backlog (List) banata hai aur decide karta hai kya important hai. Backlog means list.
  - Value delivery pe focus karta hai.
 
- **Scrum Master**:
  - Team ka manager hota hai.
  - Scrum process ko properly follow karwata hai.
  - Blockers remove karta hai, meetings organize karta hai.
  - Agile values ka protector hota hai.
 
- **Development Team**:
  - 3–9 logon ki cross-functional team hoti hai.
  - Product ko develop karti hai. Design, develop, test – sab kuch khud karti hai.
  - Self-organizing hoti hai (khud decide karti hai kaise kaam karegi).

**How does Scrum Works?**

Scrum ek sprint-based cycle hoti hai. Har sprint 1–4 weeks ka timeframe hota hai (zyadatar 2 weeks). Is cycle mein ye phases hote hain:

- **Product Backlog Ready karna**:
  - Product Owner ek prioritized list banata hai jisme wo sab features aur tasks likhta hai – ise Product Backlog kehte hain.
 
- **Sprint Planning**:
  - Sprint start hone se pehle team milke decide karti hai ki product backlog se kaunsa kaam is sprint yani timeframe mein karegi. Ye kaam banata hai Sprint Backlog.
 
- **Sprint Execution**:
  - Sprint shuru hoti hai. Team user stories pe work karti hai, Team har din milti hai Daily Scrum (Stand-up) mein – 15 min ki short meeting hoti hai:
    - Kal kya kiya?
    - Aaj kya karenge?
    - Koi dikkat hai?
   
- **Sprint Review**:
  - Sprint ke end par client ya stakeholders ke samne working product ka demo diya jata hai. Feedback milta hai.
 
- **Sprint Retrospective**:
  - Team khud milke discuss karti hai ki:
    -  Kya acha hua.
    -  Kya bura hua.
    -  Agle sprint mein kya improve kar sakte hain.


**Example: Real-Life Scrum Project**

Project: Tum ek Food Delivery App bana rahe ho.

- PO backlog banata hai: login system, restaurant list, order tracking, payment system
- Sprint Planning: Team decide karti hai ki pehle sprint mein “login system” aur “restaurant list” banega.
- Sprint Execution: 2 hafte mein ye dono features develop aur test ho jaate hain.
- Sprint Review: Client ko demo dikhaya jata hai, wo khush hota hai, bas thoda color change bolta hai.
- Sprint Retrospective: Team kehti hai ki testing thoda late hui, agli baar jaldi karenge

Agla sprint start hota hai, naye tasks ke saath — aur cycle repeat hoti hai.

**Scrum ke Fayde (Benefits)**

- Fast Feedback: Client har sprint mein software dekhta hai.
- Better Quality: Testing har sprint mein hoti hai.
- Adaptable to Change: Requirements badalne pe adjust kar sakte ho.
- Transparent Process: Sabko pata hota hai kaam kahan tak hua.


**Scrum ki Kuch Limitations**

- Har jagah Scrum fit nahi baithta (jaise hardware ya non-IT projects).
- Agar Product Owner ya Scrum Master weak hai to poora system hil sakta hai.
- Bahut frequent changes ho to planning disturb ho sakti hai.

### Technical words used in Scrum

| Term                   | Simple Meaning                                                           | Example                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Backlog        | Saare kaam ki list jo product mein chahiye.                              | "Login page banana",  "Payment gateway add karna".      |
| Sprint                 | Ek fixed time ka period (1–4 weeks)jisme kaam complete karna hota hai.   | 2 week Sprint mein  "User Registration" complete karna. |
| Sprint Backlog         | Sprint ke liye select kiye gaye kaam ki list.                            | Is Sprint mein hum login  aur registration banayenge.   |
| Increment              | Sprint ke baad tayar product ka working part                             | Sprint ke end mein working login feature.               |
| Sprint Planning        | Sprint ke start mein meeting: kya kaam karna hai decide karte hain.      | "Is Sprint mein login aur logout banayenge."            |
| Daily Scrum (Standup)  | Roz ki 15 min ki meeting: kya kiya, kya karenge, kya dikkat hai.         | "Kal API likhi, aaj front-end karunga."                 |
| Story Points           | Kaam ke difficulty ka estimation (number mein)                           | Login = 3 points, Payment = 8 points  (zyada complex).  |
| User Story             | Ek simple requirement jo user ke point of view se likhi hoti hai.        | "As a user, I want to reset my password."               |

### Kanban

Kanban is a very flexible Agile framework used to visualize work, limit work in progress (WIP), and optimize the flow of tasks from start to finish.

It’s not based on time-boxed iterations (like Scrum’s sprints); instead, it focuses on continuous delivery — as soon as something is ready, it moves forward. The word "Kanban" in Japanese means "visual signal" or "card."

<br>

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qXtV4t_WmzfTiEAxElEdPpIISHMtqgLe" width="550" height="300">

<br>

**Core Principles of Kanban**

- Visualize the Workflow:
  - Map out all your work steps visually on a Kanban board.
 
- Limit Work In Progress (WIP):
  - Set limits on how much work can be "in progress" at one time to avoid overloading.
 
- Manage Flow:
  - Focus on how smoothly tasks move from start to finish. Identify bottlenecks early.

- Make Process Policies Explicit:
  - Clearly define rules for moving tasks (e.g., when is a task considered "done"?)
 
- Implement Feedback Loops:
  - Regular check-ins to review progress and adjust if needed.
 
<br>

**How Does Kanban Work Practically?**

The main tool in Kanban is a Kanban Board — a visual system that tracks the flow of tasks.

A basic Kanban board has three main columns:
- To Do → tasks that need to be done.
- In Progress → tasks currently being worked on.
- Done → completed tasks.

Each task is represented as a card that moves from left to right across the board.

Here’s a simple flow:
- You create tasks →
- Place them in the “To Do” column →
- Pull them into “In Progress” (only when there's capacity) →
- Complete them and move to “Done”

<br>

**Kanban Process**:

- Create a Kanban Board:
  - Columns:
    - "New Tickets" → "In Progress" → "Waiting for Customer Response" → "Resolved"
   
- WIP Limits:
  - Set limits:
    - Only 5 tickets allowed in "In Progress" at a time.
   
- Pull Work:
  - As soon as a team member finishes one ticket (moves it to Resolved), they pull the next ticket from "New Tickets".
 
- Continuous Flow:
  - No sprint, no batch planning.
  - New tickets keep coming, old ones keep resolving — continuous flow.
 
- Daily Stand-up (Optional)
  - Short meeting: Discuss stuck tickets, bottlenecks.
  - Team tries to unblock issues quickly.
 
- Monitor Flow:
  - Use metrics like Cycle Time (how long a ticket takes) and Throughput (how many tickets closed per day).

<br>

**Key Components of Kanban**

| Component              | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Kanban Board           | Visual representation of tasks and workflow                    | 
| Card                   | Units of work/tasks (features, bugs, etc.)                     |
| Columns                | Stages of the workflow                                         |
| Work-In-Progress (WIP) Limits | Maximum number of tasks allowed in each column          |
| Swimlanes              | Horizontal rows to separate different types of work or teams   |
| Cycle Time             | The total time taken for a task to move from start to end      |

<br>

**Kanban Example: Food Delivery App Support Team**

Imagine you are managing support tickets for a food delivery app.
- New support tickets come in → you add them to the "To Do" column.
- The support team pulls a few tickets into "In Progress" — but because of the WIP limit (say 5 tickets max), no one overloads themselves.
- As issues are resolved, tickets move to "Done."
- Managers watch how quickly tickets are moving and spot any slowdowns (maybe payment issues take too long? Then they can add more training).

<br>

**Advantages of Kanban**
- Flexibility: No fixed sprint cycle — you can deliver anytime.
- Visibility: Everyone can see where tasks are at any time.
- Reduces Waste: You don't overcommit and avoid multitasking.
- Faster Delivery: Work moves through the system faster when bottlenecks are handled.
- Continuous Improvement: Teams regularly tweak the process for better results.

<br>

**Challenges with Kanban**
- No strict time-boxing — so deadlines can sometimes feel "loose" if not properly managed.
- Teams without discipline may ignore WIP limits.
- Too much flexibility can cause confusion if rules aren’t clear.
- Best for mature, responsible teams that can self-manage work.

<br>

### When to Choose What?

| Situation                                                                | Recommendation                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| You need regular feature releases with clear deadlines                   | **Scrum**                              |
| Your work is mostly maintenance, support, bug fixing, or unpredictable   | **Kanban**                             |
| You want strict discipline and team ceremonies (e.g., planning, reviews) | **Scrum**                              |
| You want lightweight process and continuous delivery                     | **Kanban**                             |
| Your team is new to Agile and needs guidance                             | **Scrum** (because roles & rules help) |
| Your team is mature and self-organizing                                  | **Kanban**                             |

<br>

**Example**:

Imagine you’re running two types of teams in a company:
- Scrum Team: Building a new mobile app feature like “payment integration”.
- Kanban Team: Handling daily customer support tickets and small fixes.

Each team uses the method that best fits their work nature.
