# Agile Model

Agile is a SDLC model which develop a software in small parts called Iteration or Sprints, instead building everything at once.

The Agile Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. Instead of delivering a complete product at once, Agile delivers small functional parts (called increments) in short cycles called iterations or sprints (typically 1–4 weeks).

Agile ek software development methodology hai jisme product ko small samll parts **(sprints or iterations)** main divide kiya jata hai aur develop kiya jata hai. Har sprint ek functionality hoti hai jo product ka ek part hota hai, uska demo client ko diya jata hai aur feedback liya jata hai, fir next sprint client ke feedback ke basis par plan kiya jata hai.

### Agile Model Kab Aaya?

Agile officially 2001 mein aaya jab 17 software developers ne milke ek document publish kiya jise "Agile Manifesto" kehte hain.

### Agile Manifesto

Ye 17 log (jise "Agile Alliance" kaha gaya) snowboarding trip par **Utah, USA** gaye the aur wahan brainstorming karke ek chhoti si file likhi – jise Agile Manifesto kaha gaya. Isme 4 core values aur 12 principles diye gaye.

**4 Agile Values**:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:
  - The people on the team and their communication are more important than strictly following predefined processes (like step-by-step workflows) or relying on tools (like project management software). Effective teamwork drives success.
    
- Working software over comprehensive documentation:
  - Delivering functional software (code that runs and meets user needs) is more valuable than producing detailed documentation (like extensive requirement specs or design diagrams). Documentation is useful but secondary.
    
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:
  - Work closely with the customer (or their representative, like a product owner) throughout development to understand their needs, instead of locking everything into a rigid contract upfront. Regular feedback shapes the product.
    
- Responding to change over following a plan:
  - Be ready to adapt to new requirements, issues, or priorities, even if it means changing the original project plan. Flexibility is key to delivering relevant software.

**12 Agile Principles**:

- Customer satisfaction through early & continuous delivery.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
