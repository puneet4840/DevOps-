# Agile Model

Agile is a SDLC model which develop a software in small parts called Iteration or Sprints, instead building everything at once.

The Agile Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. Instead of delivering a complete product at once, Agile delivers small functional parts (called increments) in short cycles called iterations or sprints (typically 1–4 weeks).

Agile ek software development methodology hai jisme product ko small samll parts **(sprints or iterations)** main divide kiya jata hai aur develop kiya jata hai. Har sprint ek functionality hoti hai jo product ka ek part hota hai, uska demo client ko diya jata hai aur feedback liya jata hai, fir next sprint client ke feedback ke basis par plan kiya jata hai.

### Agile Model Kab Aaya?

Agile officially 2001 mein aaya jab 17 software developers ne milke ek document publish kiya jise "Agile Manifesto" kehte hain.

### Agile Manifesto

Ye 17 log (jise "Agile Alliance" kaha gaya) snowboarding trip par **Utah, USA** gaye the aur wahan brainstorming karke ek chhoti si file likhi – jise Agile Manifesto kaha gaya. Isme 4 core values aur 12 principles diye gaye.

**4 Agile Values**:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:
  - The people on the team and their communication are more important than strictly following predefined processes (like step-by-step workflows) or relying on tools (like project management software). Effective teamwork drives success.
    
- Working software over comprehensive documentation:
  - Delivering functional software (code that runs and meets user needs) is more valuable than producing detailed documentation (like extensive requirement specs or design diagrams). Documentation is useful but secondary.
    
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:
  - Work closely with the customer (or their representative, like a product owner) throughout development to understand their needs, instead of locking everything into a rigid contract upfront. Regular feedback shapes the product.
    
- Responding to change over following a plan:
  - Be ready to adapt to new requirements, issues, or priorities, even if it means changing the original project plan. Flexibility is key to delivering relevant software.

**12 Agile Principles**:
There are 6 agile principle mentioned below.

- Customer satisfaction through early & continuous delivery:
  - Make the customer happy by delivering working software often, starting early in the project. Each delivery should provide useful functionality.
    
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development:
  - Accept new or updated requirements at any stage, even near the project’s end. Agile is designed to handle changes smoothly.

- Deliver Working Software Frequently:
  - Release usable software often, ideally every 1–4 weeks, to show progress and get feedback. Shorter cycles are preferred.
 
- Business People and Developers Work Together Daily:
  - Developers (who write code) and business stakeholders (like customers or product owners) must communicate daily to align on goals.
 
- Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals:
  - Assemble a team of motivated, skilled people, give them the tools and support they need, and trust them to do the job.
 
- Face-to-Face Communication Is the Most Effective Way to Share Information:
  - Talking **In-person or video calls are the best ways for teams to share ideas and solve problems, rather than relying on emails or documents.
 
- Working Software Is the Primary Measure of Progress:
  - The main way to judge progress is by delivering functional software, not by completing documents or tasks.

### Agile Ki Zarurat Kyun Padi?

1990s mein software projects fail hone lage the:
- Projects time par complete nahi hote the.
- Clients ka expectation change hota tha lekin system rigid hota tha.
- Testing last mein hoti thi – bugs late milte the.

Isliye developers ne socha ki ek flexible, feedback-based aur fast approach honi chahiye — jisme changes ko welcome kiya ja sake aur client ko jaldi results mil sake.

Agile is problem ka solution le kar aaya. Isme development aur feedback parallel chalte hain. Jab tum ek sprint complete karte ho (maan lo 2 hafton ka), to tumhare paas ek working software ka part hota hai. Client usse dekhta hai, use karta hai, aur turant batata hai ki kya thik hai aur kya badalna chahiye. Agla sprint fir usi feedback ko dhyan mein rakh kar hota hai.

### Agile Kaam Kaise Karta Hai? (Full Cycle)

- **Product Backlog**:
  - Client (ya Product Owner) batata hai ki usse software mein kya chahiye.
    - Example: “As a user, I want to reset my password.”
  - Ye stories ek To-Do list banai jati hai jise Product Backlog bolte hain.
 
- **Sprint Planning (Plan Banana)**:
  - Sprint ka matlab hota hai: 1–4 week ka time frame jisme kuch specific kaam complete hoga.
  - Team product backlog se kuch stories select karti hai ek sprint ke liye (1–4 week ka time box).
  - Jo user stories product backlog se sprint planning main select hoti hain unko sprint backlog kehte hain.
 
- **Design + Development**:
  - Har sprint mein selected stories ke liye coding + testing hoti hai.
  - Roz ka Daily Stand-up hota hai (15 min meeting jisme sab update dete hain).
 
- **Testing**:
  - Agile mein testing har sprint ke sath hoti hai.
  - Jaise hi feature ban jata hai, QA usse test karta hai.
  - Automation + Manual testing dono ho sakti hai.
  - Har sprint ke end mein ek working code ready hota hai.

- **Delivery (Sprint Review)**:
  - Sprint khatam hone ke baad team client ko demo dikhati hai.
  - Client feedback deta hai.
  - Agar koi change chahiye, to wo next sprint mein add hota hai.
  - Fir next sprint start hota hai.
