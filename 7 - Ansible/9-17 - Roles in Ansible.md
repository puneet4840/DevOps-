# Roles in Ansible

Ansible **roles** are a way to organize your playbook into reusable and modular components. Instead of writing all the tasks in one place, you split them into smaller, reusable pieces called roles. Each role is responsible for a specific job.

Roles break your playbook into multiple files.

```Suppose हमको एक server पर ansible के through बहुत सारे packages install करने हैं और हमने एक playbook बना ली अब उस playbook के अंदर हमने suppose 50 tasks लिख दिए अथवा और भी चीज़े|```

```जैसे handlers, variables, etc. अगर हम इस playbook को देखे तो ये playbook बहुत lengthy हो जाएगी और playbook मैं इतनी सारी चीज़े होने की वजह से हमको playbook को समझने मैं भी problem होगी|```

```तो यहाँ concept आता है ansible roles का, ansible roles क्या करते हैं की एक playbook को अलग-अलग folders के अंदर YAML files मैं define कर देते हैं जैसे Hosts के लिए अलग YAML file बनाई और उसमे hosts लिखे दिए, Tasks के लिए अलग YAML file बनाकर उसमे tasks लिखे दिए, ऐसे ही सभी अलग-अलग components को अलग-अलग YAML files मैं define कर देते हैं मतलब playbook का एक अलग structure create करना इसी को ही roles कहते हैं|```

Roles in Ansible are a way to organize your playbooks and tasks into reusable and structured components.

Imagine this:
- You want to install and configure a web server (like Nginx).
- You also want to install a database (like MySQL).

If you put everything into one playbook, it will work, but as things grow more complex, managing everything becomes difficult. This is where roles come in—they help break down tasks into smaller, reusable, and well-organized pieces.

## Why Do We Need Roles?

Imagine you’re managing a large infrastructure with many servers, and you need to:
- Install a web server like Nginx or Apache.
- Configure a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Deploy an application.

If you write all these tasks in one big playbook: 
- The playbook becomes long and hard to manage. It also become hard to read and understand it.
- It’s difficult to reuse parts of the playbook in other projects.
- Debugging or updating the tasks becomes a headache.

Roles solve these problems by split the tasks into folders with specific purposes, such as:
- Tasks: What needs to be done (install Nginx, configure it, etc.).
- Variables: Custom settings like the Nginx version or port.
- Templates: Configuration files for Nginx.
- Files: Any static files (e.g., a default web page).
- Handlers: Special tasks that only run when triggered (e.g., restarting Nginx).

Here’s why roles are important:

- **Organization**: As your infrastructure grows, writing everything in one file becomes messy. Roles organize tasks, variables, and files neatly.
  
- **Reusability**: Roles can be reused across projects. For example, if you create a role to install and configure Nginx, you can use it in multiple projects.
  
- **Team Collaboration**: In a team, roles let everyone focus on specific parts of the project. For example, one team member handles the database role, while another handles the web server role.

- **Scalability**: Roles make it easier to manage large infrastructures by breaking them into manageable pieces.

- **Readability**: Roles are easy to understand and readable than complex playbooks.

## Structure of an Ansible Role

When you create a role (using ```ansible-galaxy init <role_name>```), the following directory structure is generated by default:

```
roles/
└── <role_name>/
    ├── tasks/          # Main tasks to be executed
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── handlers/       # Handlers triggered by tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── files/          # Static files to be copied to the managed nodes
    ├── templates/      # Jinja2 templates
    ├── vars/           # Role-specific variables
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── defaults/       # Default variables for the role
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta/           # Role metadata (dependencies, author info)
    │   └── main.yml
    └── README.md       # Documentation for the role
```

### Components of Roles:

- **<role_name>**: This is the name of role directory you create using ansible galaxy command.

- **tasks**:
  - This is the directory which caontains yaml file where you write the playbook tasks to be executed on managed nodes. Tasks are executed in the order they are written.
  - ```main.yml```: This is the file where you write your paybook tasks.
 
  Example:

  ```
  # tasks/main.yml
    - name: Install Nginx
      ansible.builtin.package:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: true
  ```

- **handlers**:
  - This is the directory which contains the yaml file where you write the handlers. These handlers are those tasks which are triggered by any other task. Special tasks triggered by changes (e.g., restart a service)
  - ```main.yml```: This is the file where you write handlers. Contains tasks triggered by ```notify``` actions from other tasks.

- **files**:
  -
