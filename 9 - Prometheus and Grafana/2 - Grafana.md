# Grafana

Grafana is monitoring and data visualization tool.

Grafana is monitoring and data visualization tool which is used to monitor and visualization time-series data.

Grafana ek open-source data visualization aur monitoring tool hai jo aapko time-series data aur alag-alag types ke data sources se real-time data visualize karne ka option deta hai.

Iska major use hota hai:
- System metrics monitor karne ke liye (CPU, memory, disk usage).
- Application metrics jaise HTTP request rate, error rate, etc.
- Log monitoring.
- Alerting system create karne ke liye.

Grafana khud koi data store nahi karta, balki ye external data sources (Prometheus, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, etc.) se data pull karta hai aur usko visualize karta hai.

Basically prometheus and grafana both works together, prometheus collects and stores time-series data in their own data base but prometheus can not visualiza the data, it does not have that capability. We connect grafana with prometheus, so grafana pulls the time-series data from prometheus's database and visualize it.

**Why do we need visualization of data?**

Because data is stored in number and we can not find out any trends, analysis by seeing those number. For that we visualiza the data and easily find out the insight from it. So, that we use visualization of data.

We visualize data to make it easier to understand. Instead of looking at boring numbers or long logs, we use charts, graphs, and dashboards to see patterns, spot problems, and make quick decisions. For example, a spike in a graph instantly shows high server load, while scrolling through raw data would take much longer.
