# Linux

### What is Linux?

Just like Windows, IOS, and MacOS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular operating system in planet. An operating system is a software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your computer.

### History of Linux-

In 1969, Dennis Richie and Ken Thompson made an free operating system called **UNICS** (**U**nified **I**nformation and **C**omputing **S**ervices).

They both made changes in UNICS and in 1975 they launched (UNIX V6) operating system which was more popular at that time. Therefore, UNIX was free and open source then many companies made their own version of UNIX which was paid and costly.

Some UNIX versions:

      |--> IBM-ATX

      |--> Sun Solaris
      
      |--> Mac OS

      |--> HP-UX

In 1991, a student _Linus Trovald_ saw that companies made the UNIX OS paid. Then _Linus Trovald_ inspired from UNIX OS, write the code from scratch and made an operating system for his project that is called **_Linux_**.

Basically Linux is a kernal not an operating system.
