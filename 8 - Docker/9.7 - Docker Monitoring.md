# Docker Monitoring

Docker monitoring involves tracking the performance, resource usage, availability, and behavior of Docker containers and the Docker host environment.

It provides insights like:
- CPU and memory usage per container.
- Network I/O.
- Disk I/O.
- Container uptime and health status.

### How to Monitor Docker Containers?

Docker provides some built-in tools and commands for basic monitoring:

Example:
```
docker stats
```

This command shows a live stream of container resource usage statistics:

```
CONTAINER ID   NAME             CPU %    MEM USAGE / LIMIT    NET I/O          BLOCK I/O
d9b100f2f636   my_container     2.35%    30MiB / 2GiB         1.2MB / 800kB    3MB / 1MB
```

**Check logs of Docker Container**:

Example:
```
docker logs <container_id>
```
