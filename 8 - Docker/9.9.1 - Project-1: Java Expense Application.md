# Project-1: Java Expense Application

**Scenario**: This is three tier expense application made in java programming language. It has Frontend, Backend and Mysql database.

### Application Architecture:

**Frontend**: Frontend of this application is made in thymeleaf framework which is based on java.

**Backend**: Backend of this application is made in springboot backend framework.

**Database**: Mysql database is being used there to store the data.

**Note**: Frontend and Backend are both build using java based framework so they merged to work together. It means they have only one container that will act as both frontend and backend.

### Step-2: Create Dockerfile

We are going to create dockerfile for this project.

dockerfile

```
FROM maven:3.8.3-openjdk-17 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests=true


FROM openjdk:17-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar /app/expenseapp.jar

CMD ["java","-jar","expenseapp.jar"]
```

### Step-3: Create docker-compose.yaml file

Now creating the docker compose yaml file.

docker-compose.yaml

```
version: "3.8"

services:
  java_app:
    build:
      context: .

    container_name: 'expenseapp'

    networks:
      - "expenses-app-nw"

    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

    environment:
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: "jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/expenses_tracker?allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&useSSL=false"
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: "root"
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: "Test@123"

    depends_on:
      - mysql_db

    restart: always

    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL","curl -f http://localhost:8080 || exit 1"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 60s



  mysql_db:
    image: mysql

    container_name: "mysql"

    networks:
      - "expenses-app-nw"

    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "Test@123"
      MYSQL_DATABASE: "expenses_tracker"

    restart: always

    ports:
      - "3306:3306"

    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD","mysqladmin","ping","-h","localhost","-uroot","-pTest@123"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 60s

    volumes:
      - ./mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql


networks:
  expenses-app-nw:
```

<br>

### Step-4: Run docker-compose up command

Now run ```docker-compose up -d``` command to build and run the application.

You will access your application at ```http://localhost:8080```
