# Networking in Docker

Docker networking is the system in docker that allow two or more container communicate with each other.

```Docker networkin के thorugh एक container दूसरे container से communicate कर सकता है मतलब एक container दूसरे container को data भेज सकता है और दूसरे container से data recieve कर सकता है|```

Docker Networking is the system that allows Docker containers to communicate with:
- Each other (container-to-container communication).
- The Docker host (the machine running Docker). It means container can communicate to your machine on which you are running docker.
- The external world (like the internet). It means container can communicate to the internet.


Docker Networking ka kaam hai:
- Containers ke beech aur container se bahar (host ya internet) ke beech communication karwana.

Docker networking ke through:
- ek container dusre container se communicate karta hai.
- container host machine se communicate karta hai aur.
- container internet se communicate karta hai.

Matlab container ke beech main communication hota hai docker networking ke through.

### Why Does Docker Need Networking?

When you run applications in Docker containers:
- Each container is isolated, like a tiny virtual machine.
- But in real applications don’t run alone — they need to talk to other services.
- For example:
  - A web server container needs to connect to a database container.
  - An app might need to send data to an analytics service.
  - Multiple instances of a service might need to talk to each other.
 
Docker Networking manages how this communication happens securely, efficiently, and flexibly.

### What Happens Between Containers?

**Without Docker Networking**

If containers had no networking:
- They’d be completely isolated.
- No way to talk to each other or the outside world.

**With Docker Networking**

When Docker networking is configured:
- Containers can communicate with each other.
- They can securely send data between themselves.
- You can control who can talk to who using network rules and configurations.
- You can connect containers to specific networks or multiple networks at once.
- You can map container ports to host ports to expose services.

**Example scenario**
- Container A (web server) can ping Container B (database) using a private IP address or a DNS name like ```db```.
- Container A can access the internet through the Docker bridge, without exposing itself to the public.

### Types of Networks in Docker

There are mainly 7 types of network in docker. These are network driver.

- Bridge (Default).
- Host.
- User Defined Bridge (Custom).
- None.
- MACVLAN (Docker Swarm).
- IPVLAN.
- Overlay.

But MACVLAN, IPVLAN, OVerlay, we use these networks with docker swarm which is out dated now. But we will most focus in Bridge, Host, Custom Bridge, None. These are most common.

### Bridge Network

A **bridge** network is a private internal network created by Docker on a single host. 

Containers connected to the same bridge network can communicate with each other directly via their IP addresses, while being isolated from external networks unless explicitly published through port mapping.

The bridge network is the default network driver for containers. When you run a container without specifying a network, it connects to the bridge network by default.

By default:
- When Docker is installed, it automatically creates a default bridge network called ```bridge```.
- Any container you run without specifying a network gets connected to this bridge network.

Bridge ek default Docker network type hai jo ek private internal network banata hai containers ke liye. Iske andar sab containers ek dusre se communicate kar sakte hain via IP

### How it works internally?

**Jab hum Docker install karte hain**:
- Docker ek default bridge network create karta hai, jiska naam hota hai: ```bridge```.
- Iske saath ek Linux bridge interface banta hai: ```docker0```. This acts like a virtual Ethernet switch inside your host.
- Ye Linux bridge interface ek virtual switch ka kaam karta hai — jisme containers plug-in ho jaate hain.
- Each container gets a virtual Ethernet interface (veth pair).
- When you start a container:
  - Docker creates a veth pair: two virtual network interfaces that are connected like a pipe.
  - One end is attached to the container’s network namespace.
  - The other end is attached to the ```docker0``` bridge on the host.

**Jab aap container run karte ho (e.g. docker run nginx)**:
- Agar aap kuch specify nahi karte ```--network``` flag se, toh container automatically default bridge network me chala jaata hai.
- Container ko ek private IP milti hai, jaise ```172.17.x.x```.
- Ye IP ```docker0``` ke subnet se hoti hai.
- Container ke andar DNS hota hai jisse woh internet access bhi kar sakta hai NAT ke through. Iska matlab hai container by default internet ko access kar sakta hai.

**NOTE**: When we create a two tier application with Frontend and Database. Frontend needs data from database to run perfectly. So, by default containers can not communicate directly with each other. They can communicate using their ip but ip can change by time. So, we consider that contiainers can not communicate with each other.

### Why containers don’t talk to each other in default bridge?

Jab aap 2 containers run karte ho:
```
docker run -d --name web nginx
docker run -d --name app httpd
```

Dono default bridge me jaate hain, lekin default bridge network mein container-name se communication ka support nahi hota. So agar web container app ko access karna chahe:
- ```ping app``` ❌ fail hoga
- IP se karoge toh kaam karega — but IP dynamic hoti hai, toh reliable nahi ha.

**NOTE**: So is problem ko deal karne ke liye hum custom bridge banate hain jisse containers apas main ek dusre se by name connect kar pate hain.

### Why we need custom bridge for multi-tier applications?

Multi-tier app ka matlab hota hai: e.g. frontend + backend:
- Frontend needs to talk to backend.
- Backend may need to talk to DB.

Agar aap custom bridge banao:
```
docker network create my-bridge
```

Phir containers ko isme run karo:
```
docker run -d --name backend --network my-bridge backend-image
docker run -d --name frontend --network my-bridge frontend-image
```

Toh ab:
- Frontend backend ko container-name se access kar sakta hai:``` http://backend:port```.
- Ye name-based service discovery enable karta hai.
- Internally Docker ek DNS server chalaata hai network ke andar jo ye kaam karta hai

To jab custom bridge network se containers by name connect kar sakte hain to agar dynamic ip change bhi hota hai kisi bhi reason se to containers ke beech main by name connectivity bani rahegi. Isliye hum containers ko connect karne ke liye custom bridge network use karte hain.

**Diagram**:
```
HOST
├── docker0 (default bridge)
│   ├── containerA (172.17.0.2)
│   └── containerB (172.17.0.3)
│       [Can't resolve names by default]

├── br-abc123 (custom bridge)
│   ├── containerX (172.18.0.2, name: 'db')
│   └── containerY (172.18.0.3, name: 'web')
│       [Can resolve names using Docker DNS]
```

### Host Network

In Docker host network, a container shares the network stack of the Docker host itself. It means docker access the newtork of your machine on which you are running docker.

```Host network mode में container directly host का network use करता है - faster but less secure.```

That means:
- The container does not get its own isolated network namespace.
- It uses the same IP address as the host machine.
- Any ports opened by the container are opened directly on the host’s network interfaces.

Host network ka matlab hota hai ki container host ke network stack ko share karta hai — yani koi alag virtual network create nahi hoti.

Jab container ko --network host ke saath run karte ho, toh:
- Container ke paas apna khud ka network namespace nahi hota.
- Container directly host machine ke IP aur ports use karta hai.

### How does it work internally?

Normal (Bridge) mode me:
- Docker har container ke liye ek virtual Ethernet interface (veth pair) banata hai.
- Ye veth bridge network se connect hota hai (docker0 ya custom bridge).
- Isme container ka apna network namespace hota hai.

But host network mode me:
- Container ka network namespace = host ka network namespace.
- Iska matlab: container host ke network interfaces, ports, routing table, DNS sab use karta hai as is.

### Example — Host Network in action

**Default (bridge) mode**:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

- Host ke ```8080``` port se map karke container ke ```80``` port pe request jaati hai.
- Docker internally port mapping karta hai (via iptables/NAT).

**Host mode**:
```
docker run -d --network host nginx
```

- Ab container host ke saare ports ko directly access kar sakta hai.
- Agar nginx container ```80``` pe listen kar raha hai, toh host ke ```80``` pe direct bind ho jaayega
- No ```-p``` required, kyunki koi mapping nahi ho rahi — direct bind ho raha hai

### Limitations & Considerations
- **Port conflicts**:
  - Since containers share the host network, two containers can’t bind to the same port.
 
- **Security implications**:
  - The container has direct access to the host’s network.
  - The container has direct access to the host’s network.
 
### Use-cases of Host Network
- High performance apps (like proxies).
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus Node Exporter, etc.).
- Low-latency apps (game servers, real-time apps).

### Tip:
- Host network mein container ```netstat```, ```ss```, ```ifconfig``` run karega toh host ke interfaces dikhte hain — test karne ke liye:
```
docker run -it --network host alpine sh
apk add net-tools
netstat -tuln
```

### None Network

In None network mode a container has no network connectivity at all.

Meaning:
- No virtual Ethernet interface.
- No access to the host’s network.
- No communication with other containers.
- No internet access.
- No DNS.

The container will still have its own network namespace, but it won’t be connected to anything.

Jab aap container ko ```--network none``` ke saath run karte ho, tab:
- Container ka koi network connection hi nahi hota — na bridge, na host, na internet, kuch bhi nahi.

Yeh mode mainly tab use hota hai jab aap:
- Container ko network se completely isolate karna chahte ho.
- Sirf CPU, memory, or storage-related tasks test kar rahe ho.
- Security sandboxing chahte ho.

### How it works internally?

When you run a container with ```--network none```:
- Docker creates a new, empty network namespace for the container.
- This namespace has no network interfaces except for the loopback interface (lo).

This loopnack interface allows the container to communicate with itself, facilitating inter-process communication within the container. It uses the IP address 127.0.0.1, also known as localhost. 

Example inside container:
```
ip addr
```

Will show:
```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
```

In none networks:
- No veth pair is created.
- No connection to the host network.
- No bridge, no routing, no NAT.

Internal Loopback Only:
- The only available interface is the loopback (lo) interface. Processes inside the container can talk to each other through localhost (127.0.0.1), but nothing outside.

### Common misconception: None ≠ Private

Kuch log samajhte hain ki none network matlab private network — lekin aisa nahi hai. Ye no network at all hota hai. Agar aapko private-but-communicating containers chahiye toh custom bridge use karo, none nahi.

### Usecase of None network

| Use-case                    | Explanation                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 High isolation needed    | Jab aap chahte ho ki container totally isolated ho — no network attacks                      |
| 🧪 Testing                  | Agar aap sirf application ke CPU ya file I/O parts test kar rahe ho                          |
| 🔍 Security sandboxing      | Research ya analysis tools jo safe environment me chahiye                                    |
| 🛠️ Custom networking setup | Jab aap khud manually network setup karte ho (e.g. `macvlan`, or `nsenter` se connect karna) |

### Tip:

Aap chaho toh none mode me container chalu karo, fir baad me usko kisi network me attach bhi kar sakte ho:
```
docker network connect my-bridge container_name
```
Isse flexibility milti hai: pehle isolated run karo, fir zarurat ho toh network de do.

### Custom Bridge Network

A custom bridge network is a user-defined bridge network that you create explicitly, separate from Docker’s default bridge network.

We create custom bridge network because we want to make communication between two containers using thier container names, simple!.

Custom bridge ek user-defined Docker network hota hai, jisme containers:
- Ek isolated private network me hote hain.
- Aapas me container-name se communicate kar sakte hain (DNS-based).
- Host ke through internet bhi access kar sakte hain.
- IP, subnet, gateway etc. bhi customize kiya ja sakta hai.

Ye basically ek custom version of default bridge hai, but zyada powerful aur flexible.

### What problem Custom Bridge netowrk solves

Agar tum do containers run karo — ek app, ek DB — aur dono ko connect karo ```--network bridge``` pe, toh:
- App container DB container ke naam se connect nahi kar paayega (e.g., mysql).
- ```ping mysql``` fail hoga.
- Aur humko containers ko aapas main by container name connect karta hota hai kyuki default bridge main ip se connect hote hain, agar ip se connect karne lage aur humko pta hai container ko jo ip milti hai vo dynamic hoti hai. To ip se connect kane par agar ip change ho gyi to connectivity lost ho jayegi aur app down ho jayega. Isliye custom bridge ka use karke hum contianers ko unke naam se connect karte hain bss.

### How Does a Custom Bridge Network Work Internally?

When you create a custom bridge network, Docker does the following internally:

- **Creates a New Linux Bridge Interface**:
  - Docker creates a new Linux bridge device on the host machine (e.g., br-<random-id>).

  Example:
  ```
  docker network create --driver bridge my_bridge
  ```
  Creates:
  - A virtual switch interface ```br-abc123```.
  - A private subnet (e.g. ```172.18.0.0/16```).
 
- **Provides an Embedded DNS Server**:
  - Custom bridge networks automatically provide a small DNS server that maps container names to their IP addresses.
  - This allows containers to resolve each other by name:
    ```
    ping backend
    ```
    → resolves to ```172.18.0.3``` internally.

- **Connects Containers via veth Pairs**:
  - Each container gets:
    - A veth pair (Virutal Ethernet).
    - One end inside the container (```eth0```).
    - The other end attached to the new bridge (```br-abc123```).
   
- **NAT for Internet Access**:
  - Outbound traffic is NATed through the host interface, allowing containers to access the internet unless explicitly blocked.
 
### How to create Custom Bridge Network

**Create a custom bridge network**:
```
docker network create my-custom-net
```

**Run containers in Custom Bridge Network**:
```
docker run -dit --name backend --network my-custom-net nginx
docker run -dit --name frontend --network my-custom-net alpine sh
```

Ab aap frontend container me jaake backend ko ping kar sakte ho:
```
ping backend
```
Ye kaam karega — kyunki ```my-custom-net``` DNS support karta hai.
