# Networking in Docker

Docker networking is the system in docker that allow two or more container communicate with each other.

```Docker networkin के thorugh एक container दूसरे container से communicate कर सकता है मतलब एक container दूसरे container को data भेज सकता है और दूसरे container से data recieve कर सकता है|```

Docker Networking is the system that allows Docker containers to communicate with:
- Each other (container-to-container communication).
- The Docker host (the machine running Docker). It means container can communicate to your machine on which you are running docker.
- The external world (like the internet). It means container can communicate to the internet.


Docker Networking ka kaam hai:
- Containers ke beech aur container se bahar (host ya internet) ke beech communication karwana.

Docker networking ke through:
- ek container dusre container se communicate karta hai.
- container host machine se communicate karta hai aur.
- container internet se communicate karta hai.

Matlab container ke beech main communication hota hai docker networking ke through.

### Why Does Docker Need Networking?

When you run applications in Docker containers:
- Each container is isolated, like a tiny virtual machine.
- But in real applications don’t run alone — they need to talk to other services.
- For example:
  - A web server container needs to connect to a database container.
  - An app might need to send data to an analytics service.
  - Multiple instances of a service might need to talk to each other.
 
Docker Networking manages how this communication happens securely, efficiently, and flexibly.

### What Happens Between Containers?

**Without Docker Networking**

If containers had no networking:
- They’d be completely isolated.
- No way to talk to each other or the outside world.

**With Docker Networking**

When Docker networking is configured:
- Containers can communicate with each other.
- They can securely send data between themselves.
- You can control who can talk to who using network rules and configurations.
- You can connect containers to specific networks or multiple networks at once.
- You can map container ports to host ports to expose services.

**Example scenario**
- Container A (web server) can ping Container B (database) using a private IP address or a DNS name like ```db```.
- Container A can access the internet through the Docker bridge, without exposing itself to the public.

### Types of Networks in Docker

There are mainly 7 types of network in docker.
