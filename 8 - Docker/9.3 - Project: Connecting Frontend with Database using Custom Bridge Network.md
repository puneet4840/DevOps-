# Project: Connecting Frontend with Database using Custom Bridge Network

**Scenario**: We are creating a Frontend app using Flask which we are connecting with MySql database. So that frontend app can access data from database. This is a Two-Tier application project.

**How we will be doing it?**
- Get the Two-Tier application from github.
- Create custom bridge network.
- Run the both container adding with custom bridge network.
- You can access the application.

### Step-1: Get the code from Github

We have to clone the code from url: https://github.com/LondheShubham153/two-tier-flask-app.git

There will be docker file in the code, we have to use that docker file. I am mentioning that dockerfile below.

**DockerFile**
```
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# install required packages for system
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get upgrade -y \
    && apt-get install -y gcc default-libmysqlclient-dev pkg-config \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install app dependencies
RUN pip install mysqlclient
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Specify the command to run your application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Step-2: Build the Docker image from docker file

Now build the docker image from docker file using below command

```
docker build -t two-tier-app:v1 .
```

It will generate your docker image with name two-tier-app:v1

### Step-3: Run a MySQL database container 

Run a mysql database container, so that your frontend app can use it to store data.

```
docker run -d --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=devops mysql:5
```

A sql container will be running now.

### Step-4: Create a Custom Bridge Network 

Create a custom bridge network so that app and database container both can connect with each other.
