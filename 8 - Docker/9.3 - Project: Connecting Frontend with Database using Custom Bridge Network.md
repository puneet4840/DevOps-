# Project: Connecting Frontend with Database using Custom Bridge Network

**Scenario**: We are creating a Frontend app using Flask which we are connecting with MySql database. So that frontend app can access data from database. This is a Two-Tier application project.

**How we will be doing it?**
- Get the Two-Tier application from github.
- Create custom bridge network.
- Run the both container adding with custom bridge network.
- You can access the application.

### Step-1: Get the code from Github

We have to clone the code from url: https://github.com/LondheShubham153/two-tier-flask-app.git

```
git clone https://github.com/LondheShubham153/two-tier-flask-app.git
```

There will be docker file in the code, we have to use that docker file. I am mentioning that dockerfile below.

**DockerFile**
```
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# install required packages for system
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get upgrade -y \
    && apt-get install -y gcc default-libmysqlclient-dev pkg-config \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install app dependencies
RUN pip install mysqlclient
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Specify the command to run your application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Step-2: Build the Docker image from docker file

Now build the docker image from docker file using below command

```
docker build -t two-tier-app:v1 .
```

It will generate your docker image with name two-tier-app:v1

### Step-3: Create a Custom Bridge Network 

Create a custom bridge network so that app and database container both can connect with each other.

```
docker network create two-tier -d bridge
```

### Step-4: Run a MySQL database container with custom bridge network

Run a mysql database container with custom bridge network, so that mysql container can connect to network.

```
docker run -d --name mysql --network two-tier -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=devops mysql
```

A sql container will be running now which will be connected to bridge network.

### Step-5: Run you app container with custom bridge network

Run your app container with custom bridge network, so that app can connect to database container.

```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --network two-tier -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DB=devops two-tier-app:v1
```

### Step-6: Your app will be running

You can access your app on ```127.0.0.1:5000```

### Step-7: Check data in database

If you want to check the data in database, you can go inside mysql container and login to mysql

```
docker exec -it mysql bash

mysql -u root -p root

show databases;

#Table would be messages

show tables;

select * from messages;
```
