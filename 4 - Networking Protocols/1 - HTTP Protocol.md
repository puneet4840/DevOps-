### What is a Protocol?

Protocol are the rules defined by the Internet Society which ensure how the data should transfer between the devices. It ensures that the data packets must completely sent to receiver and inform during the failure and success.

```
Protocol rules hote hain jo Internet Society ek organization hai usne banaye the jab internet ki shuruaat hui thi.
Ye rules batate hain ki do devices ke beech main data kaise tranfer hota hain. In rules ki wajah se data packets completely receiver
ke pass jate hain aur agar koi data packet receiver ke paas nahi pahunch pata hai to usko information sender ko dete hain.

Inhi rules ko protocol kaha jata hai.
