### History of Nginx

```A Russian developer named **Igor Sysoev** was frustrated because old web servers couldn't handle **more than 10,000 requests at the same time**. This issue is know as **C10k Problem**. To solve this problem, Igor Sysoev started developing Nginx in **2002**. His goal was to build a web server that could efficiently handle a huge number of connections without using too much memory or system resources. He worked on this project for years, and the first public release of Nginx came out in October 2004.```
