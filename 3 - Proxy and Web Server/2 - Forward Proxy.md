# Forward Proxy

### What is a Proxy?

Proxy is a machine or set of machines that sits in-between two systems(Client and Server).

A proxy server acts as a intermediary between client and server.

e.g.,

```Suppose you want to access a website xyz.com of USA. You saw that access is denied to the user of India to that website. You search for proxy website for xyz.com``` 
```There are lists of many websites, You click anyone of them and xyz.com website is accessible to you.```
