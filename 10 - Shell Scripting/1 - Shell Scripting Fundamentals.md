# Shell Scripting

A Shell is a program that provides an interface to the user to use the operating system services.

A Shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform actions.

A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) program that allows users to interact with an operating system by entering commands. It acts as a middleman between the user and the operating system kernel.
- You type a command, the shell interprets it, and passes it to the OS to execute.
- It also displays the output of that command back to you.

```Shell एक program होता है जो user को operating system के kernal के साथ interact करवाता है| इसका मतलब है की user CLI Interface पर एक command लिखता है, इस command को CLI operating system के kernal तक पहुँचता है और kernal का output user को दिखता है|```

### What is Shell Script?

A shell script is a text file with ```.sh``` extension in which we write shell commands in it.

A shell script is essentially a text file containing a sequence of shell commands. Instead of typing each command manually, you can write them all in a script and execute them together. It’s a way to automate tasks on a system.

```Shell script एक text फाइल होती है जिसमे आप multiple shell commands लिखते हो, और इस file को execute करते हो जिससे script के अंदर लिखी हुई commands एक-एक करके run होती है|```
