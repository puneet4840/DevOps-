# Authentication and Authorization in Kubernetes

The Kubernetes API server is the central component that handles all communication with the Kubernetes cluster. It is the primary interface for users, applications, and even internal Kubernetes components to interact with the cluster. When it comes to **authentication** and **authorization**, the API server plays a key role by deciding who can access the cluster, what they can do, and where they can do it.

### Overview of the API Server in Kubernetes

The API server is a RESTful service that exposes the Kubernetes API, meaning it has a set of endpoints that handle different resources in Kubernetes, like Pods, Nodes, and ConfigMaps. The API server:

- Receives requests (e.g., ```kubectl get pods``` or a request from an application).
- Authenticates the request to verify the identity of the requester.
- Authorizes the request to determine if the requester has the necessary permissions.
- Passes the request to the appropriate component if it’s allowed.

### Step-by-Step Flow: How the API Server Handles a Request

Let’s go through each step that happens when a user sends a request to the API server, using ```kubectl``` as an example.

**Step 1: User Sends a Request**

  Suppose you run a command like:

  ```kubectl get pods --namespace dev```
