# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the container management tool which is used to manage conatiner deployment, container scaling and descaling and load balancer.

```Kubernetes containers को manage करने के लिए एक tool होता है जिससे हम containers की automatic deployment करना, Scaling और De-scaling करना और containers के बीच मैं load को balance करना ये सब operations हम kubernetes के through करते हैं```

It was developed by google but now it is maintained by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

**Before Kubernetes**

Before kubernetes applications were built based on **Monotlithic architecture** that means applications have single codebase for entire application and hosted on physical servers or virtual machines. During that time scaling was slow, updates cause downtime and resources were often wasted. 

**After Kubernetes**

With the rise of **Containerization**(like Docker) and **Kubernetes** the applications started building based on **Microservice Architecture** that means applications are broken into microservices where each part (e.g., user service, payment service) codebase is seperate and developed, deployed and scaled seperately.
